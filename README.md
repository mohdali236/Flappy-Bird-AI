# Flappy-Bird-AI

Project Name: Flappy Bird AI
Author: Muhammad Ali

This project utilizes the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm to train an AI agent to play the Flappy Bird game. The AI learns to navigate through pipes by evolving neural networks that control the bird's movements, specifically its jumps, to maximize its fitness score.
